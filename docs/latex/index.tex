 This project is a graphical programming language that allows the user to enter commands into a Windows Form to draw shapes and lines onto a canvass. The user can enter commands and run them individually with the run button, or type \textquotesingle{}run\textquotesingle{} into the textbox to run all of the commands one after another.

Using the save and load function, all of user input lines can be saved to a text file and loaded later to be ran in the application.

The cursor is represented by a small circle on the bitmap canvass and shapes will be drawn from the cursor with the shape centering over the cursor.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Commands}{Commands}}\label{index_autotoc_md1}
{\bfseries{moveto (integer,integer)\+:}} Moves the cursor to the coordinates specified by the user

{\bfseries{drawto (integer, integer)\+:}} Draws a line from the current cursor location to the coordinates specified by the user

{\bfseries{clear\+:}} Clears the drawing canvass

{\bfseries{reset\+:}} Resets the cursor to the 0,0 position of the canvass

{\bfseries{run\+:}} Runs the commands entered in the left panel, line by line

{\bfseries{rectangle (integer,integer)\+:}} Draws a rectangle onto the canvass, using the parameters for width and height

{\bfseries{circle (integer)\+:}} Draws a circle onto the canvass, using the integer parameter for the radius of the circle

{\bfseries{pen (red/blue/green/black)\+:}} Change the colour of the pen drawing onto the canvass

{\bfseries{fill (on/off)\+:}} Fill on to draw solid filled shape, off to draw hollow shape outlines
